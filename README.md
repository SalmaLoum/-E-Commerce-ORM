# E-Commerce-ORM

> Module 13

## Description

This app is the back end for an e-commerce site. It's configured by a working Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

- Make sure to `npm i MySQL2` and `Sequelize` packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database.

- You'll also need the `dotenv` package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

- Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands.

- Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
